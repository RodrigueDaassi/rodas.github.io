          <p class="nomarginafter nomarginbefore descriptif">This study represents a part of our doctoral research. We characterized the lignins from the ramial chipped wood of Gmelina arborea and Sarcocephalus latifolius to assess their contribution to stable humus formation in vegetable soils in Benin. It is the first study conducted on these two agroforestry species in Benin, and the results will contribute to soil fertility restoration. These findings were presented at the 4th World Agroforestry Congress.</p>

          <p class="nomarginafter"><b>Optimization of the Electrospray Process to Produce Lignin Nanoparticles for PLA-Based Food Packaging</b> - with Daassi, Rodrigue Khasa, Damase P Stevanovic, Tatjana</p>
          <p class="nomarginafter nomarginbefore descriptif">The development of new processing methods is required in order to meet the continuous demand for thinner films with excellent barrier properties for food packaging and other applications. In this study, rice husk organosolv lignin nanoparticles were prepared using the electrospray method, which were applied to produce polylactic acid (PLA)-based films for food packaging. The effect of the following electrospray parameters has been investigated: lignin concentration (LC) ranging from 5–50 mg/mL, flow rate (FR) from 0.5–1 mL/min, applied voltage from 10–30 kV, and tip-to-collector distance (TCD) from 10–25 cm, on the morphology, size, polydispersity index (PDI), and Zeta potential (ZP) of lignin nanoparticles (LNPs). The response surface methodology with a Box-Behnken design was applied to optimize these parameters, while dynamic light scattering (DLS) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analyses were used to characterize the controlled LNPs. The results showed that the LNPs shape and sizes represent a balance between the solvent evaporation, LC, applied voltage, TCD and FR. The application of optimal electrospray conditions resulted in the production of LNPs with a spherical shape and a minimal size of 260 ± 10 nm, a PDI of 0.257 ± 0.02, and a ZP of −35.2 ± 4.1 mV. The optimal conditions were achieved at LC = 49.1 mg/mL and FR = 0.5 mL/h under an applied voltage of 25.4 kV and TCD = 22 cm. Then, the optimized LNPs were used to improve the properties of PLA-based films. Three types of PLA-lignin blend films were casted, namely lignin/PLA, LNPs/PLA and PLA-grafted LNPs. PLA-grafted LNPs exhibited a more uniform dispersion in PLA for lignin contents of up to 10% than other composite samples. Increasing the lignin content from 5% to 10% in PLA-grafted LNPs resulted in a significant increase in elongation at break (up to four times higher than neat PLA). The presence of PLA-grafted lignin led to a substantial reduction in optical transmittance in the UV range, dropping from 58.7 ± 3.0% to 1.10 ± 0.01%, while maintaining excellent transparency to visible light compared to blends containing lignin or LNPs. Although the antioxidant capacity of unmodified lignin is well-known, a substantial increase in antioxidant capacity was observed in LNPs and PLA-grafted LNP films, with values exceeding 10 times and 12 times that of neat PLA, respectively. These results confirm the significant potential of using studied films in food packaging applications.</p>

          <p class="nomarginafter"><b>Effect of ramial chipped wood and poultry manure amendments on soil chemical properties and fungal communities in Benin</b></p>
          <p class="nomarginafter nomarginbefore descriptif">This study investigated effects of soil amendments with ramial chipped wood (RCW) derived from Gmelina arborea and Sarcocephalus latifolius, together with poultry manure, on soil chemical properties and fungal communities in northern and southern Benin. The trial was a split-plot experiment, where treatments included volume of irrigation water (V1 and V2 = 0.5 *V1) as the whole-plot factor, with organic amendment (45 t/ha RCW; 15 t/ha poultry manure, PM; 45 t/ha RCW + 15 t/ha of PM, RCW_PM; and control) as the sub-plot factor. Topsoil was sampled before and after 24 months of in situ organic amendment application. Humic acid (HA) was extracted from soil and purified prior to FTIR spectroscopy, NMR, and Py-GC-MS analyses. RCW treatments (RCW and RCW_PM) contributed substantially to organic carbon storage and soil nutrient (N, P, K, Ca, Mg) increases (the latter by up to 1.5 times) compared to the control. Accordingly, soils that were amended with the RCW produced significant amounts of HA. High concentrations of lignin-related compounds were determined in pyrolysis products from humic acids in the RCW-amended soils. Using ITS2 region sequencing on the Illumina Miseq platform, RCW amendments markedly altered fungal compositions, with increased relative abundance of Ascomycota (up to 92% of total fungal community), Mucoromycota (2.7%), Basidiomycota (2.5%) and Rozellomycota (0.3%). These fungal phyla contain species that participate in organic matter decomposition and compound transformations but did not selectively degrade lignin in RCW. Our results suggest that RCW amendments significantly increased fungal activity and improved soil nutrient availability. Thus, this agro-technology is recommended for regenerative agriculture.</p>

          <p class="nomarginafter"><b>Chemical characterization of tropical ramial and trunk woods and their lignins in view of applications in soil amendments, 2020</b></p>
          <p class="nomarginafter nomarginbefore descriptif">We have determined the chemical properties of Gmelina arborea and Sarcocephalus latifolius trunk wood (TW) and ramial chipped wood (RCW), in order to examine the applicability of RCWs in soil amendments. The results of the study of S. latifolius represent the first report on this species. Characterizations of TW and RCW samples included determination of extractives, Klason and acid soluble lignin, major monosaccharides, ash, and mineral constituents. Higher contents of total lignins and monosaccharides were found in RCW than in TW for S. latifolius, while opposite results were obtained for G. arborea. The organosolv lignins isolated from the studied samples were analyzed by HPLC, FTIR, GPC, 31P NMR and HSQC methods. The studied lignins belong to guaiacyl-syringyl (G–S) type, with a predominance of G units in S. latifolius and S units in G. arborea lignins. Based on obtained results, RCW samples from S. latifolius could be anticipated performing well in soil amendment trials, as indicated by their lower C/N ratios and higher mineral and lignin contents.</p>

          <p class="nomarginafter"><b>Monitoring transformation of two tropical lignocellulosics and their lignins after residence in Benin soils, 2021</b></p>
          <p class="nomarginafter nomarginbefore descriptif">Thermally assisted Hydrolysis and Methylation (THM), and 2D-heteronuclear single quantum coherence nuclear magnetic resonance (2D HSQC NMR) spectroscopy were used to monitor the transformation of ramial chipped wood (RCW) from Gmelina arborea and Sarcocephalus latifolius, together with their organosolv lignins, following soil incubation in Benin (West Africa). Mesh litterbags containing RCW were buried in soils (10 cm depth) and were retrieved after 0, 6, 12 and 18 months of field incubation. Chemical analysis showed that total carbohydrate content decreased, while total lignin content increased as RCW decomposition progressed. Ash and mineral content of RCW increased significantly after 18 months of decomposition in soil. Significant N-enrichment of the RCW was determined following 18 months incubation in soils, reaching 2.6 and 1.9 times the initial N-content for G. arborea and S. latifolius. Results of THM showed that the S + G sum, corresponding to lignins, increased with RCW residence time in the soils, in contrast to the response of compounds derived from carbohydrates, the sum of which decreased. Remarkably, lignin interunit linkages, most notably β-O-4′ aryl ethers, β-β′ resinol, β-5′ phenylcoumaran and p-PCA p-coumarate, survived after 18 months in the soil, despite their gradual decrease over the duration of the experiment.</p>

          <p class="nomarginafter"><b>Influence du régime d'inondation sur la source de carbone : dégagement de CO2 d'un sol hydromorphe de bas-fond rizicole au Sud-Bénin</b></p>
          <p class="nomarginafter nomarginbefore descriptif">This study evaluates the carbon source potential of a rice lowland by measuring the release of carbon dioxide (CO2) under three soil flooding regimes. The experiment was conducted at the seed production site of Awokpa lowland in the Zè district in southern Benin (6°32 and 6°87 N, 2°13 and 2°26 E). The lowland was subjected to three flood regimes representing the study treatments: T1: soil without flooding; T2: soil with flooding followed by drainage, and T3: soil with permanent flooding. Each treatment was replicated four times. The measurement of CO2 release from the soil in situ under rice cultivation was carried out by trapping with a sodium hydroxide solution (0.5N). The results reveal that the CO2 release varies significantly based on the flood regime. Treatment T1 has the highest potential for CO2 release (7.63 mg.m^-².h^-1), followed by T2 (4.2 mg.m^-².h^-1), and T3 (1.54 mg.m^-².h^-1). Furthermore, the study showed that depending on the water saturation regime in the lowland, the amount of CO2 released is inversely proportional to the organic carbon content of the soil. In the context of this study, intelligent climatic agriculture is recommended as one of the approaches to maintain a more sustainable soil-climate-agriculture system.</p>
