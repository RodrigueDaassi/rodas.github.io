        In my free time, I enjoy playing the piano, saxophone, and singing, with a particular passion for gospel music. I have also served as a choir master, leading and directing choirs in various performances. My love for music extends beyond just playing instruments; it is a way for me to connect with my community and express my creativity.

        <br/><br/>

        Additionally, I have a passion for reading, cycling, and engaging in meaningful conversations with people. I believe in the power of communication and sharing knowledge, which helps me build strong relationships and contribute positively to my community.

        <br/><br/>

        Beyond music and other activities, I have a keen interest in various other pursuits. My involvement in the Association des Béninois de Québec showcases my dedication to fostering cultural connections and supporting community initiatives. Additionally, I enjoy exploring new technologies and applying my analytical skills to personal projects, ranging from experimental design development to innovative applications in smart farming.

        <br/><br/>

        My commitment to sustainable practices is not limited to my professional work. I actively seek out ways to incorporate eco-friendly habits into my daily life, whether through gardening, recycling, or promoting environmental awareness among my peers.

        <br/><br/>

        For me, hobbies are not just pastimes; they are integral to my overall well-being and professional growth. They provide a balance that allows me to return to my research with renewed energy and fresh perspectives.
