        My professional journey spans over 10 years, exploring diverse realms within sustainable agriculture and biosourced materials. With a Ph.D. in Wood Engineering and Biosourced Materials from Université Laval, my expertise lies in sustainable soil fertility management, biomass refining, and lignin valorization.
        <br/><br/>
        Currently, I contribute my skills as a researcher at Biopterre, focusing on the in vitro multiplication of carnivorous plants, the valorization of cannabis residue extracts for the biological control of soil fungi, and the isolation and characterization of lignins from agricultural residues. My work also extends to the production of nanoparticles and innovative applications in the field of smart agriculture. Beyond the laboratory, I apply my skills in statistical modeling, using tools like R, SAS, and others to derive valuable insights from complex agricultural data.

        <br/><br/>
        An autonomous and dynamic professional, I have honed my communication skills through various teaching roles, including assisting in courses like "Chimie du bois" and "Problèmes forestiers et sylviculture en région tropicale." This academic background positions me as a versatile and driven contributor to sustainable agricultural practices.
        <br/><br/>
        Outside of my academic pursuits, I have a deep passion for languages – not just the programming kind. Fluent in French and English, I enjoy bridging gaps through effective communication. My commitment to sustainable practices extends beyond the professional realm, as showcased through my involvement in the Association des Béninois de Québec.
        <br/><br/>
        With a knack for problem-solving and a love of emerging technologies, I find parallels between my affinity for soil conservation and my research efforts into biomass valorization.
        <br/><br/>
        In addition to my academic and professional pursuits, I have over 10 years of experience in musical exploration, specializing in piano, saxophone, drums, and musical arrangement. This creative outlet complements my analytical mindset, adding a harmonious touch to my multifaceted profile.
